Calculation of NDVI,NBR, dNBR from Landsat-8 image
NDVI is used to measure vegitation density and change in growth of land. Whereas NBR is used to identify the burned area.
In this repository I have calculated dNDVI and dNBR to detect change in land between 2015-16.
Dataset of state Assam was collected from USGS Earth Explorer.
